# MajiSafe Demo Video Script (5 minutes)

## [0:00-0:30] Problem & Solution
"Hi, I'm demonstrating MajiSafe - turning DeFi into drinkable water for rural Africa. 

The problem: 2 billion people lack clean water access, often due to corruption and poor infrastructure.

The solution: Blockchain payments directly activate water pumps via SMS, eliminating middlemen."

## [0:30-2:00] Live Demo
"Let me show you how it works:

1. **Web Interface**: Open MajiSafe app
2. **Connect Wallet**: MetaMask to Base Sepolia network
3. **Purchase Water**: 0.001 ETH for 1 water credit
4. **Blockchain Transaction**: Show transaction on Base explorer
5. **SMS Command**: AI bridge sends 'P01' to ESP32
6. **Pump Activation**: Water flows for 10 seconds"

## [2:00-3:00] Technical Architecture
"The system has 3 layers:

1. **Blockchain**: Base L2 for low-cost transactions
2. **AI Bridge**: Python service converts blockchain events to SMS
3. **Hardware**: ESP32 with SIM card controls physical pump

All built with Claude 3.5 Sonnet in just 2 hours - that's Vibe Coding!"
